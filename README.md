# Birthday-Application

This android application keeps on switching the image on taping the screen at the same time song is being played in the  background.


All you need to do is :

    copy all your images into res/drawable/ (Note: images should be in the pattern image1.jpg, image2.jpg, image3.jpg... or you can change the image name pattern in the )
    
    take a note of the number of the photos that you added in the res/drawable directory bcz you need to enter the number of the images that need to open your application in bday/application/BirthdayActivity.
    
    copy a song into the path res/raw/ that you like to play it in background.
    
    
    Remainder : make sure that image size should not be more than 1 mb / picture (lesser is still more better , you can resize the image on ms-paint or you can reduce the picture quality online.
    
# Happy Birthday :)
